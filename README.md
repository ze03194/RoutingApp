**Routing App**

A Python CLI Routing App that automates the loading of packages on to delivery trucks, while considering any special constraints a package may have.
Through the use of data structures and algorithms, the program recursively determines the shortest distance between the truck's current location and the target address
of the next potential package.
Users can view the status of any or all packages at any given time.
